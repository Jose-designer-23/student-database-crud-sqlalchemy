# student-database-crud-sqlalchemy
This project implements a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing student records. It utilizes SQLAlchemy as the Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the database, which is automatically created. The student data is presented visually using HTML tables.
